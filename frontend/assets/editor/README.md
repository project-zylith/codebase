# DEPRECATED: Quill Editor Files

These files are no longer used in Renaissance. The app now uses TenTapEditorNew for rich text editing.

## Files to be deleted:

- `quill.min.js` - Quill.js library
- `quill.snow.css` - Quill styling
- `editor.html` - Quill editor HTML template
- `offline-editor.html` - Offline Quill editor template

## Safe to delete after testing that TenTapEditorNew works correctly.
