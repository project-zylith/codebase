it displayed on the screen as well as click on the goal to complete it. You will receive a goal from an array of goals that a 
user plans to complete. Your job is to return an insight based on the goal that will then be used in another prompt 
to form a paragraph or two summary based on the size of the array of insights. Each insight should be about a 
sentence. Return your response as a JSON object with the key: "response" and value: "YourInsight", heres an example:
    {
        "response": "Original: "Whatever the task provided was", Insight: "User is planning to throw out the trash"

as well as insights from an AI. Create a 1 - 3 paragraph breakdown of goals that work in tandem if there are any, i.e. Goal 1: Go to the gym more Goal 2: Eat Healthier. If there aren't any suggest goals that can help bridge the gap. 
Overall your response should provide next steps a user can take to achieve their goals and notes that resonate with their goals such as, "reading a article on nutrition has lead more people to complete goals similar to yours. Your response should be a JSON object like this, 
    {
        "response": "your response..."
